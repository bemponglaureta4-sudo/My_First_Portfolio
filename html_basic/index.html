  <h1>Welcome to My First Cool Webpage</h1>
  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <h3>A Little More Detail</h3>

  <!-- Paragraphs -->
  <p>This is the very first paragraph of my cool webpage. It feels awesome to build something from scratch!</p>
  <p>HTML is the foundation of every webpage. With just a few tags, we can create structure and meaning for content.</p>
  <p>I'm learning how to add headings, paragraphs, and images into my web pages as part of my portfolio project.</p>
  <p>By the end of this journey, I'll have a collection of web projects to showcase my skills.</p>
